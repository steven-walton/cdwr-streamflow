# cdwr-streamflow

## Introduction
This repository is for requesting, wrangling, and visualizing Colorado Department of Water Resources streamgauge data.
Data is sourced from the [Colorado Department of Water Resources](http://cdss.state.co.us/onlineTools/Pages/StreamflowStations.aspx).

## Functinality
1. Access or scrape data from CDWR's streamflow webpage using python's Requests and BeautifulSoup4 modules
2. Process streamflow data to provide summary statistics as well as simple time series, seasonal, and diurnal plots within the Matplotlib plotting library.

## Installation
Currently, the library is stored in streamflow.py, with simple examples of functionality in test.py. In the future, setup.py and \_\_init__.py will be added so that the library can be imported to python as a module.
