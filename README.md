# cdwr-streamflow

## Introduction
This repository is for requesting, wrangling, and visualizing Colorado Department of Water Resources streamgauge data.
Data is sourced from the [Colorado Department of Water Resources](http://cdss.state.co.us/onlineTools/Pages/StreamflowStations.aspx).

## Todo List
1. *In progress* Create basic functionality for accessing and reading streamgauge data from CDWR's website 
2. Create tools for summary statistics and common visualization of collected streamflow data, simple time series, seasonal, diurnal plots
3. Develop app for viewing streamgauge stats/plots with real-time updates.
4. Add streamgauge notification system allowing users to recieve updates by SMS or e-mail when a gauge exceeds or drops below a specified value, similar to USGS's water alert
